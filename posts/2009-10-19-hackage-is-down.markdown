Tonight I decided it was time to sink my teeth in to
[Happstack](http://happstack.com), the Haskell application server stack.
I'm very keen to see how well Haskell handles web based applications and
I really like the ideas behind Happstack.State. Unfortunately it looks
like I may have picked the worst time of all as
[Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org) seems to be down, so no "cabal
install" for me!

Lets see how I go getting the dependencies by hand...
