Today I came across a really cool UI concept for an IDE called Code
Bubbles. You can check out the video
[here](http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/acb/codebubbles_site.htm).

I love the idea of having a massive workspace and being able to see
relevant functions side by side. It was also really cool how you can
email workspaces around with annotations.
