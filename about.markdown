My name is Jacob Stanley and I'm a software developer from Perth,
Western Australia. I work on a development team which mainly uses C# and
C++ to build software for the [offshore survey
industry](http://www.fugro.com.au/divisions/survey/offshore-survey). I
have a keen interesting in functional, side effect free and parallel
programming, so [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org) has become my
favourite language to use when I'm not at work. This blog contains my
random musings on various technical subjects.
